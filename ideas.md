## Dataset 1 - NBA Elo Ratings (FiveThirtyEight)
**URL:** https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-elo
**Why I chose it:** I like analyzing sports trends through statistics.
**Questions**
1. Do teams with top Elo ratings at midseason usually make playoffs?
2. How much do losing streaks impact Elo
   ### I would answer this by analyzing a teams elo before a game and after a game. If a team loses multiple games in a row then I would compare that to teams that stop losing streaks. Conversely, I could look at teams that are on winning streaks and see how a win streak effects elo ranks. Like, there might be two teams that go 50-32, but one team is streaky. What team is then looked upon more favorably, a streaky team that has had its streaks of winning and losing? or a team that is more consistently winning and losing games.
